# Hey there, I'm Tanmeen ðŸ‘‹

I'm a high school senior just dabbling in coding and making websites primarily. Having a curious mind for as long as I can remember, I like to learn anything and everything that interests me.

I'm somewhat fluent in HTML5, CSS, and Python. I like poring over the design aspect of everything with the intention of making it look good and as a result, I have developed a knowledge of how to use design tools like Figma, Adobe XD, Coolors, Framer, and PixlrE. 

Currently,
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on a [JS Library Book Issuing system](https://faizaan-nasir.github.io/Library/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning web development from [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also learning Python in my school
- ðŸ¤” I want to learn Tailwind CSS

- âš¡ Fun fact: I take an unjustified amount of time selecting an ice cream flavour
